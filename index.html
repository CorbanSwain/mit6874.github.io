    <h2 class="module-header">Course description</h2>
    <p>Welcome to a new approach to computational problems in the life sciences. This subject is not an encyclopedic summary of contemporary methods in systems biology and genomics. Rather, we will explore both conventional and deep learning approaches to key problems in the life sciences, comparing and contrasting their power and limits.</p>

    <p>Our aim is to enable you to evaluate a wide variety of solutions to key problems you will face in this rapidly developing field, and enable you to execute on new enabling solutions that can have large impact.</p>
    
    <p>As part of the subject you will become an expert in using modern cloud resources to implement your solutions to challenging problems, first in problem sets that span a carefully chosen set of tasks, and then in an independent project. You will be programming using Python and TensorFlow in Jupyter Notebooks on the Google Cloud, a nod to the importance of carefully documenting your work so it can be precisely reproduced by others.</p>

    <h2 class="module-header">Prerequisites</h2>
	<p>You should be comfortable with calculus, linear algebra, (Python) programming, probability, and introductory molecular biology. This will be a fast paced course, and it is targeted towards students that are both mathematically and computational capable. There are many other subjects at MIT that teach overviews of computational biology that are less demanding, we would be happy to recommend other options if you find this subject is not what you desire.</p>
    
    <h2 class="module-header">Class meeting times and places</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Lecture: TR1-2.30 (32-155)</li>
        <li>Recitation: TBD</li>
    </ul>

	<h2 class="module-header">Syllabus</h2>
    Detailed syllabus can be found <a href="syllabus.html">here</a>.
  
    <h2 class="module-header">Contact</h2>
    <p>You should feel free to contact the lecturer and the TAs about any questions through <a href="mailto:6.874staff@mit.edu">6.874staff@mit.edu</a>. The best way to get detailed questions answered is to attend TA office hours and recitation.</p>

    <h2 class="module-header">Grading</h2>
    <p>Grading will be based upon three programming-intensive problem sets (40%), a comprehensive exam (30%), and a final project (30%). Class participation both in lecture and recitation will be used to adjust grades. Attendance in lecture is important as the class moves quickly and you will need to be present. There will be an option for some students to give presentations on relevant research papers from the syllabus list. If you opt to present a paper in class it will be graded and substitute for a problem set of your choice. For 6.874, 20.490, and HST.506[J] there will be an extra section on each problem set that is specialized by course (6, 20, HST).</p>

    <h2 class="module-header">Project</h2>
    <p>This subject has a substantial deep learning project component. Projects will be completed either as a team of two or individually. 6.874 students must complete an individual project unless permission from the teaching staff is given to work as a team. You are free to chose a problem in the life sciences and develop a deep learning solution using the subject’s cloud resources. Ideas will be provided along with example data, and you can consult the teaching staff to get advice for other ideas or to refine your own ideas.</p>

    <h2 class="module-header">Textbook</h2>
    <p>We will be using the book “Deep Learning” by Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville. You can find the book online <a target="_blank" href="http://deeplearningbook.org">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/janishar/mit-deep-learning-book-pdf">here</a>. You can purchase a hard copy <a target="_blank" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/deep-learning">here</a> or on Amazon.</p>

    <h2 class="module-header">Tutorials</h2>
    <p>We collected a series of pointers to tutorials on Numpy, Tensorflow, Google Cloud and Conda <a href="tutorials/main/">here</a>.</p>
